<img class="img-responsive" style="float: right; margin: 0px 20px 20px 0px;" src="/files/headshot.jpg" width="350">I am a PhD candidate in Economics at the University of Chicago. My research interests are in public and labor. My work explores how policies interact with labor markets and other economic networks.

**I am on the 2024-2025 academic job market.** A draft of my job market paper will be posted soon to this website. If you would like to contact me, my email address is: <a href="mailto:ovolpe@uchicago.edu">ovolpe@uchicago.edu</a>.
