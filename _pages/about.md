<img class="img-responsive" style="float: left; margin: 0px 20px 20px 0px;" src="/files/headshot.jpg" width="350">I am a PhD student in Economics at the University of Chicago. My research interests are in public and labor. Recent projects explore how public policies interact with social and economic networks.

I previously graduated with an M.S. in Applied Mathematics and a B.A. in Economics from Johns Hopkins University in 2019. In my free time, I enjoy hiking, cooking, and playing the piano.
