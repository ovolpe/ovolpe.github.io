I am a PhD candidate in Economics at the University of Chicago. My research interests are in public and labor. My work explores how policies interact with labor markets and other economic networks.

To contact me, my email is: <a href="mailto:ovolpe@uchicago.edu">ovolpe@uchicago.edu</a>.

**I am on the 2024-2025 academic job market.**

# Working Papers
### **Job Preferences, Labor Market Power, and Inequality**
_Job Market Paper (Draft Coming Soon)_ <br>

**Abstract:** I analyze how an employer's labor market power is shaped by its workforce composition and evaluate the implications for welfare and inequality. Using matched worker-firm panel data from Norway (1995-2018), I develop and estimate an equilibrium model that integrates labor market frictions with individual variation in workers' trade-offs between wages and non-wage job characteristics. The model captures a rich set of worker sorting patterns, causing wage markdowns and rents to vary with the composition of a firm's workforce. I find that this variation leads to substantial allocative inefficiency, with welfare losses from imperfect competition estimated at 9.5% relative to the competitive benchmark.


### [**Discrete Choice with Generalized Social Interactions**](/files/dcwgsi_paper.pdf)
_Revision Requested at **Econometrica**_; [*Supplemental Materials*](/files/dcwgsi_supplement.pdf)<br>

**Abstract:** This paper explores how identity affects individual behavior through social interactions. I study a discrete choice model where agents wish to conform to the actions of some members of their network, while deviating from the actions of others. Under this generalized framework, I explore what aggregate outcomes arise from noncooperative decisionmaking. I characterize the uniqueness and stability of equilibria, and I discuss implications of negative spillovers for welfare and inefficiency. Additionally, I demonstrate how the model may be taken to data. I introduce a novel identification strategy that accounts for unobserved network effects by leveraging within-network variation in individual characteristics. I also construct internal instruments to overcome the issue of measurement error, which is a primary source of endogeneity in network-based models with incomplete information. Finally, I apply this methodology using data from the large-scale education experiment Project STAR, where I find robust evidence of gender differences in peer effects.
