[**Discrete Choice with Generalized Social Interactions**](/files/dcwgsi_paper.pdf)<br>
_Revision Requested at **Econometrica**_; [*Supplemental Materials*](/files/dcwgsi_supplement.pdf)<br>

This paper explores how identity affects individual behavior through social interactions. I study a discrete choice model where agents wish to conform to the actions of some members of their network, while deviating from the actions of others. Under this generalized framework, I explore what aggregate outcomes arise from noncooperative decisionmaking. I characterize the uniqueness and stability of equilibria, and I discuss implications of negative spillovers for welfare and inefficiency. Additionally, I demonstrate how the model may be taken to data. I introduce a novel identification strategy that accounts for unobserved network effects by leveraging within-network variation in individual characteristics. I also construct internal instruments to overcome the issue of measurement error, which is a primary source of endogeneity in network-based models with incomplete information. Finally, I apply this methodology using data from the large-scale education experiment Project STAR, where I find robust evidence of gender differences in peer effects.
